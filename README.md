Hey there.

So, a couple of things. I made a branch called playgroundVersion, to use in lieu of master.
I was messing around with it to make sure it was working all right.  I downloaded the ZIP file, and that works with no hitches. 
It looks different from what you're used to, but changes happen the same way.

When I switch from master to playgroundVersion branch it wasn't giving me problems...yet.  But we'll hold off on merging at all 
until we've done a significant amount of work.  I would save a copy for safekeeping as you move forward, 
somewhere outside of Documents with a different file name because I'm not sure how to roll back changes on GitHub right now.  

I'm only using playgroundVersion for this week and probably next week.
